## Prerequisites

### Operating System

### Tools and Libraries
- **Selenium**: For automating browser tasks.
- **X API**: For interacting with X.com (Twitter).

### Chrome Setup
To use Chrome with remote debugging enabled, you'll need to run the following command in your local terminal to start Chrome:

Cancel all other chrome tabs so they do not interfere.
